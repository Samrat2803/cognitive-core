# 🚀 TEST THIS NOW!

## ✅ Everything is Fixed and Ready

**Status**: 
- ✅ Backend server running on port 8000
- ✅ Map visualization fixed
- ✅ All errors resolved
- ⏳ **Need you to test in UI**

---

## 🎯 Test These 2 Queries

### **Query 1** (in your frontend):
```
sentiment on Hamas in US and Israel
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Sentiment analysis response
- ✅ 2 artifacts: Data table + Bar chart
- ✅ Shows sentiment scores for US and Israel

---

### **Query 2** (in the same conversation):
```
create the map visualization for this data
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ **World map appears showing US and Israel** 🗺️
- ✅ Countries colored by sentiment (red = negative)
- ✅ Interactive (hover shows details)
- ✅ Legend showing "Sentiment Score"

**NOT Expected**:
- ❌ Another bar chart
- ❌ Error messages
- ❌ Re-running sentiment analysis

---

## 🎉 What to Look For

When map is created, you should see:

### **In the UI**:
1. New artifact card appears
2. Type: "Map Chart"
3. Interactive world map
4. US and Israel are highlighted
5. Colors show sentiment intensity

### **In the Backend Logs** (optional):
```bash
tail -f backend_v2/app.log
```

Look for:
```
🎯 Artifact Decision: True
   Type: map_chart  ← CORRECT! (was "bar_chart" before)
   
🎨 Artifact Creator: Creating map_chart
✅ Map created successfully
```

## 📸 Screenshot & Report

After testing, please tell me:

1. ✅ **Did the map appear?**
2. ✅ **Does it show US and Israel?**
3. ✅ **Are the colors correct?**
4. ❌ **Any errors or issues?**

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

**Problem**: Still shows bar chart instead of map

→ Share backend logs around the "create map" query

**Problem**: Map shows but wrong data

→ Share screenshot of the map

**Problem**: Error messages

→ Share the error text
