## 🔍 Verified Capabilities

### ✅ Master Agent
1. **Query Reception** - Receives user's natural language query
2. **Intent Analysis** - Detects "situation report" requests
3. **Parameter Extraction** - Extracts period (daily/weekly) and region from query
4. **Delegation Logic** - Routes to appropriate sub-agent
5. **Error Handling** - Gracefully handles unrelated queries
6. **Response Formatting** - Presents results in user-friendly format

### ✅ SitRep Generator Sub-Agent
1. **Parameter Processing** - Handles period and region filters
2. **Event Retrieval** - Loads data from Live Monitor
3. **Priority Ranking** - Categorizes events by urgency
4. **Regional Grouping** - Groups events by country/region
5. **Executive Summary** - LLM-generated summary
6. **Watch List** - LLM-generated monitoring items
7. **Artifact Generation** - Creates HTML, TXT, JSON reports

### ✅ Integration Layer
1. **Lazy Loading** - Sub-agent loaded only when needed
2. **Module Isolation** - No conflicts with other sub-agents
3. **Error Propagation** - Errors reported back to master agent
4. **Data Flow** - Complete data structure passed between layers
5. **Observability** - Full logging throughout the pipeline

## 🔄 Complete Data Flow

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **User Input**
   ```
   "Generate a daily situation report"
   ```

2. **Master Agent Processing**
   ```python
   # Analyze intent
   intent = detect_intent(user_query)  # → SITUATION_REPORT
   
   # Extract parameters
   period = extract_period(user_query)  # → "daily"
   region = extract_region(user_query)  # → None
   ```

3. **Delegation**
   ```python
   result = await sub_agent_caller.call_sitrep_generator(
       period="daily",
       region_focus=None
   )
   ```

4. **Sub-Agent Execution**
   ```
   Event Retriever → 6 events from Live Monitor
   Priority Ranker → 1 urgent, 3 high, 2 notable
   Event Grouper → 3 regions identified
   Executive Summarizer → LLM generates 4-sentence summary
   Watch List Generator → LLM generates 10 watch items
   Artifact Generator → HTML, TXT, JSON created
   ```

5. **Response Formation**
   ```python
   response = {
       "success": True,
       "executive_summary": "...",
       "priority_breakdown": {...},
       "artifacts": [...]
   }
   ```

6. **User Presentation**
   ```
   Formatted output displayed to user
   Artifacts made available for download
