    "tools_to_use": ["tavily_search", "tavily_extract"],
    "execution_strategy": "Search for visualization best practices"
}
```

**Logic Executed:**
- JSON parsing: ✅ Success
- Extracted tools: `["tavily_search", "tavily_extract"]`
- **Keyword fallback:** NOT TRIGGERED (disabled)
- **Issue:** LLM didn't recognize this as visualization request needing actual chart creation

**Output:**
- `tools_to_use`: ["tavily_search", "tavily_extract"]
- `reasoning`: "Need to provide guidance on visualization techniques"

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial - LLM selected search tools instead of recognizing visualization need

**Analysis:** The Strategic Planner LLM interpreted the request as "how to create visualizations" rather than "create a visualization for me". This is because:
1. The prompt doesn't explicitly tell LLM about artifact creation capability
2. No "create_plotly_chart" tool in AVAILABLE_TOOLS list
3. LLM defaulted to providing informational guidance

- Potential job losses in textiles/gems

USER: create a trend visualization of this data

Agent's Response:
### Trend Visualization of US Tariffs Impact...
[Guidance about chart types, not actual data]

TASK 1: Decide if data visualization is appropriate
TASK 2: Determine best chart type
TASK 3: Extract ALL structured data

IMPORTANT:
- If user says "create a chart for THIS", look in CONVERSATION HISTORY
- Extract data from EITHER current response OR conversation history

Respond with JSON only:
{
    "should_create": true,
    "chart_type": "line_chart",
    "data": {...}
}
```

**LLM Response:**
```json
{
    "should_create": true,
    "chart_type": "line_chart",
    "data": {
        "x": ["Before Tariffs", "After Tariffs"],
        "y": [null, null],
        "x_label": "Time Period",
        "y_label": "Export Values (in billions)"
    },
    "title": "Impact of US Tariffs on India's Export Sectors"
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Correctly detected need for visualization
- ✅ Chose appropriate chart type (line_chart for trends)
- ⚠️ **Data extraction issue:** `y` values are `null`
  - LLM couldn't extract concrete numerical values from Turn 1
  - Turn 1 mentioned "$48.2 billion threatened" but not time series data
  - No "before vs after" numeric values in conversation history

**Output:**
- `should_create_artifact`: True
- `artifact_type`: "line_chart"
- `artifact_data`: Data structure with null values
- `artifact_title`: "Impact of US Tariffs on India's Export Sectors"
- Routing: → Artifact Creator

## 📊 Summary & Key Insights

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **Conversation Manager**
   - Successfully maintained conversation history across turns
   - Properly tracked artifacts (when created)
   - Clean state management

2. **Strategic Planner (Turn 1)**
   - LLM correctly selected tools WITHOUT keyword fallback
   - Identified need for both search and sentiment analysis
   - Proper JSON output format

3. **Tool Executor**
   - Both Tavily and sub-agent tools executed correctly
   - Error handling worked properly
   - Results properly stored in state

4. **Decision Gate**
   - Correctly decided when to proceed vs loop
   - Iteration tracking working

5. **Response Synthesizer**
   - Generated high-quality, well-structured responses
   - Used conversation history for context
   - Proper citation extraction

6. **Artifact System**
   - Detection logic working (keyword matching)
   - S3 upload successful
   - File generation working
   - Presigned URLs created

### Issues Identified ⚠️

1. **Strategic Planner (Turn 2) - Critical Issue**
   - **Problem:** LLM interpreted "create a trend visualization" as request for information ABOUT visualization, not to create one
   - **Why:** 
     - AVAILABLE_TOOLS description doesn't mention artifact creation capability
     - No explicit "create_artifact" or "plotly_chart" tool in the list
     - LLM has no context that the system can actually create charts
   - **Fix Needed:** Add artifact creation to AVAILABLE_TOOLS description

2. **Artifact Decision - Data Extraction Issue**
   - **Problem:** Extracted `y` values as `[null, null]`
   - **Why:** Turn 1 response had qualitative data ("affected", "$48.2B threatened") but no time-series numerical values
   - **Root cause:** User query asked about general impact, not specific metrics over time
   - **LLM behavior:** Correctly tried to extract data, but source data wasn't numeric time series
   - **Fix Needed:** Better handling when source data isn't suitable for requested chart type

3. **Keyword Fallback Disabled**
   - Status: Working as intended for debugging
   - Note: When re-enabled, would have helped in Turn 2 by catching "visualiz" keyword

### Conversation History Context ✅

**Turn 1 → Turn 2 Context Flow:**
- ✅ Turn 1 response fully available in Turn 2 conversation history
- ✅ Response Synthesizer received full Turn 1 context
- ✅ Artifact Decision node received full Turn 1 context
- ✅ LLM could see previous discussion about tariff impacts
- ⚠️ Data was qualitative, not quantitative time series

### Agent Reasoning Quality

**Turn 1:**
- **Strategic Planner:** Excellent - identified appropriate tools
- **Response Synthesizer:** Excellent - comprehensive, well-cited response

**Turn 2:**
- **Strategic Planner:** Suboptimal - didn't recognize artifact creation intent
- **Artifact Decision:** Good - detected visualization need, attempted extraction
- **Response Synthesizer:** Good - provided helpful guidance (though not requested)

---

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

### 1. Update Strategic Planner Prompt (High Priority)

**File:** `nodes/strategic_planner.py`

**Current Issue:** AVAILABLE_TOOLS doesn't mention artifact creation

**Fix:** Add to config.py AVAILABLE_TOOLS:
```python
"artifact_creation": {
    "description": "Create data visualizations (charts, graphs, plots) from conversation data",
    "use_for": ["create chart", "visualize", "plot this", "show graph", "trend visualization"]
}
```

### 2. Enhance Artifact Decision Prompt (Medium Priority)

**File:** `nodes/artifact_decision.py`

**Current Issue:** Doesn't handle qualitative data well

**Fix:** Add to extraction prompt:
```
If the conversation data is qualitative (descriptions, not numbers):
- Extract key metrics if mentioned ($48.2B → 48.2)
- Create categorical comparisons (affected vs unaffected)
- Use bar charts for categorical data instead of line charts
- If no extractable data, set should_create: false and explain why
```

### 3. Add Data Validation (Medium Priority)

**File:** `nodes/artifact_creator.py`

**Add before creating chart:**
```python
def validate_data(data, chart_type):
    if chart_type == "line_chart":
        if None in data.get('y', []) or len(data['y']) == 0:
            return False, "No numerical data available for line chart"
    return True, "OK"

valid, message = validate_data(artifact_data, artifact_type)
if not valid:
    state["error_log"].append(f"Data validation failed: {message}")
    state["should_create_artifact"] = False
    return state
```

### 4. Re-enable Keyword Fallback (Post-Debug)

**File:** `nodes/strategic_planner.py`

**When to do:** After core agent logic is debugged and working

**Action:** Uncomment lines 122-142

---

## 🎯 Test Conclusion

**Overall Agent Performance:** 🟡 Partially Successful

**What Actually Happened:**
1. ✅ Turn 1: Excellent information gathering and response
2. ⚠️ Turn 2: System tried to create visualization but:
   - Strategic Planner didn't recognize intent
   - Data extraction found no numerical time series
   - Artifact created but with empty data points

**What Should Have Happened:**
1. Turn 1: Same (already optimal)
2. Turn 2: Should have either:
   - **Option A:** Created bar chart comparing affected vs unaffected sectors (categorical)
   - **Option B:** Explained that source data doesn't contain time-series numbers needed for trend visualization
   - **Option C:** Asked user to provide specific metrics to visualize

**Learning:** The agent needs:
- Better intent recognition for artifact creation
- Smarter data type matching (qualitative → categorical charts, quantitative → trend charts)
- Validation before creating empty artifacts
