# Media Bias Detector - Integration Success Report

**Date:** October 2, 2025 - 7:40 PM  
**Status:** ✅ **INTEGRATION COMPLETE AND TESTED**

---

## 🎯 Integration Objective

Integrate the Media Bias Detector sub-agent with the master agent so that the master agent can automatically delegate media bias queries to this specialized sub-agent.

---

- Includes proper sys.path management to avoid module conflicts
- Returns structured results with bias classification, loaded language, framing analysis
- Full error handling and logging

### 2. Updated Tool Executor ✅
**File:** `backend_v2/langgraph_master_agent/nodes/tool_executor.py`

- Added handler for `media_bias_detector_agent` tool
- Extracts results and logs execution
- Properly handles sources and time_range_days parameters

### 3. Updated Master Agent Configuration ✅
**File:** `backend_v2/langgraph_master_agent/config.py`

- Added `media_bias_detector_agent` to `AVAILABLE_TOOLS`
- Comprehensive description of capabilities
- Clear use cases for when to trigger this agent
- Example queries that should route to this agent

## 📊 Detailed Analysis Results

### Bias Classification (From Test)
| Source | Political Lean | Bias Score | Confidence |
|--------|----------------|------------|------------|
| **CNN** | Center-Left | -0.30 | High |
| **Reuters** | Center | 0.00 | High |
| **BBC** | Center-Left | -0.25 | High |
| **Fox News** | Right | +0.50 | High |

**Bias Range:** -0.30 (left) to +0.50 (right)

### Key Findings (AI-Generated)
1. CNN and BBC often frame climate change discussions in a way that highlights the urgency of the issue, while Fox News tends to downplay these concerns.
2. Fox News employs defensive language when addressing criticisms of its climate coverage, suggesting a bias towards protecting its editorial stance.
3. Reuters stands out for its neutral reporting, avoiding emotionally charged language and maintaining a focus on factual content.

### Loaded Language Examples
- **Total Phrases Detected:** 40 (10 per source)
- **Categories:** Emotionally charged, sensationalist, fear-based, propaganda terms, dysphemisms, loaded adjectives

### Framing Analysis
- **Dominant Frame:** Conflict Frame (all 4 sources)
- **Interpretation:** All sources present climate policy as a debate/conflict rather than using other frames like economic or morality

## 🔍 Agent Response Sample

```
### Comparison of CNN and Fox News Coverage on Climate Change Policy

When examining how CNN and Fox News cover climate change policy, there are notable 
differences in tone, emphasis, and accuracy. Here's a detailed comparison based on 
the gathered information:

#### General Tone and Emphasis
- **CNN**:
  - CNN generally portrays climate change in a more positive or neutral light. The 
    network is more likely to affirm that global warming is real and happening, often 
    focusing on the scientific consensus...

- **Fox News**:
  - Fox News tends to present climate change in a more skeptical light, often 
    questioning the scientific consensus...
```

**Analysis:** The master agent successfully synthesized the media bias detector's findings into a coherent, comparative response that directly addresses the user's query.
