- **Status:** Coordinated deployments, final validation

## 🚀 Core Development Principles

### **Backend Development Principles**
- **🔄 Use Existing Code as Much as Possible**
  - Preserve POC algorithms (`geo_sentiment_poc.py`, `geo_sentiment_agent.py`, `agent_utils.py`) unchanged
  - Wrap existing functionality instead of rewriting
  - Leverage current MongoDB, Redis, and AWS infrastructure
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing `/research` endpoint

- **📱 MVP-First Development**
  - Phase 1: Basic functionality with existing code integration
  - Phase 2: Enhanced features and real-time capabilities  
  - Phase 3: Polish, optimization, and advanced features

- **🧪 Test-Driven Development**
  - Write test cases before coding any feature
  - Follow Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle
  - Maintain test hierarchy: Unit → Integration → API → E2E

### **Frontend Development Principles**
- **📱 MVP-First Development**
  - Phase 1: Basic chat interface with simple message display
  - Phase 2: WebSocket integration and enhanced UX
  - Phase 3: Advanced features, animations, and polish

- **🔄 Build on Existing Foundation**
  - Keep current React setup and deployment process
  - Enhance existing components rather than rebuilding
  - Maintain responsive design and accessibility features

## 🔄 Critical Success Factors

### **API Contract Compliance**
- **Backend Team:** Must implement APIs exactly as specified in API_CONTRACTS.md
- **Frontend Team:** Must consume APIs exactly as specified
- **Changes:** Any contract changes require approval from both teams

### **WebSocket Communication**
- **Real-time requirements:** Sub-100ms message delivery
- **Connection management:** Auto-reconnection, graceful degradation
- **Message format:** Strict adherence to specified message types

### **Deployment Infrastructure**
- **Backend:** Use existing AWS Elastic Beanstalk setup (no changes)
- **Frontend:** Use existing S3/CloudFront deployment (no changes)
- **URLs:** Maintain current production URLs throughout

### **POC Algorithm Integration**
- **Preserve existing code:** Don't modify core POC algorithms
- **Wrapper approach:** Create service layer around POCs
- **Performance:** Maintain current analysis speed (< 60 seconds)

## 📊 Team Communication Structure

### **Daily Status Updates (3x daily)**
- **9:00 AM:** Morning standup and blocker identification
- **2:00 PM:** Progress check and cross-team coordination
- **6:00 PM:** End-of-day status and next-day planning

### **Communication Channels**
```
🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES → Tag @architecture-lead immediately
🟡 INTEGRATION BLOCKERS → Post in team channel, tag team leads
🟢 GENERAL QUESTIONS → Team channel during business hours
📋 STATUS UPDATES → Update TEAM_STATUS_TRACKING.md
```

### **Escalation Procedures**
1. **Team Lead** (First point of contact)
2. **Architecture Lead** (Technical decisions)
3. **Project Manager** (Resource/timeline issues)
4. **Emergency Channel** (Production issues)

## 🎯 Key Integration Points

### **Week 2 Critical Dependencies**
| Frontend Needs | Backend Provides | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|----------------|------------------|------------|------------|
| WebSocket connection | `/ws/{session_id}` endpoint | 🟡 MEDIUM | Mock WebSocket for development |
| Chat API | `/api/chat/message` endpoint | 🟡 MEDIUM | Mock API responses |
| Authentication | JWT token validation | 🟢 LOW | Use development tokens |
| Real-time updates | WebSocket message streaming | 🟡 MEDIUM | Graceful degradation |

### **Week 3 Integration Testing**
- **End-to-end chat flow:** User message → Backend processing → Response display
- **Real-time analysis:** Analysis start → Progress updates → Results display
- **Error scenarios:** Network failures, API errors, timeout handling
- **Performance testing:** Multiple concurrent users, large analysis loads
