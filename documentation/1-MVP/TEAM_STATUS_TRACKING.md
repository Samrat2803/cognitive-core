## 📱 Communication Tools Integration

### Recommended Tools Setup

#### Option 1: Slack/Discord Integration
```javascript
// Automated status posting
const updateTeamStatus = (teamName, taskId, status, progress) => {
  postToChannel({
    channel: '#dev-status',
    message: `${teamName}: ${taskId} - ${status} (${progress}%)`
  });
};
```

#### Option 2: GitHub Issues Integration  
- Create issues for each task
- Use labels: `backend`, `frontend`, `integration`, `blocker`
- Assign team members
- Track progress with project boards

#### Option 3: Notion/Airtable Dashboard
- Real-time status updates
- Dependency tracking
- Automated progress reports
- Integration timeline visualization

## 🎯 Best Practices for Parallel Development

### Communication Guidelines
1. **Over-communicate** - Better to share too much than too little
2. **Status updates** - Update status even if no progress made
3. **Block early** - Report blockers as soon as identified
4. **Document decisions** - All technical decisions logged
5. **Integration first** - Prioritize integration points

### Technical Guidelines
1. **API contracts** - Never change without team agreement
2. **Mock data** - Use consistent mock data for development
3. **Error handling** - Implement graceful degradation
4. **Testing** - Write tests alongside development
5. **Documentation** - Update docs with every change

### Process Guidelines
1. **Daily updates** - Non-negotiable status updates
2. **Weekly syncs** - Mandatory all-hands meetings
3. **Code reviews** - Cross-team reviews for integration points
4. **Deployment coordination** - Synchronized deployment schedules
5. **Rollback plans** - Always have rollback procedures ready
