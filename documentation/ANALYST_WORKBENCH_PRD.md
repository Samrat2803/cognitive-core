# Political Intelligence Analyst Workbench - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Political Intelligence Analyst Workbench is a conversational AI-powered platform that enables political analysts to perform comprehensive geopolitical sentiment analysis through natural language interactions. The platform combines the intuitive chat interface of modern AI assistants (ChatGPT, Cursor) with specialized political intelligence capabilities, real-time agent monitoring, and methodological bias detection.

## Product Vision

**"Empower political analysts with AI-driven intelligence gathering that is transparent, controllable, and methodologically rigorous."**
