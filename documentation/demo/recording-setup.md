- Backend/Analytics: 45 seconds (impressive infrastructure)
- Demo 2: 15 seconds (quick, sped up)
- Conclusion: 15 seconds (strong finish)

Total: 4 minutes exactly

# Narration tips:
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Pause briefly between sentences
- Emphasize key technical terms
- Maintain professional, confident tone
- Practice transitions between sections
```

## üîß **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Recording Problems**
```bash
# Video issues:
- Choppy recording: Lower frame rate to 30fps, close other apps
- Large file size: Adjust bitrate settings, use hardware encoding
- Audio sync: Record video and audio separately if needed

# Audio issues:  
- Background noise: Use noise suppression in OBS
- Low volume: Increase microphone gain (test first)
- Echo: Move closer to mic, add soft furnishings to room

# System performance:
- Close unnecessary applications
- Disable real-time antivirus scanning temporarily
- Use SSD storage for recording if available
- Monitor CPU/memory usage during recording
```

### **Demo Failures**
```bash
# If live system fails during recording:
- Have backup screen recordings ready
- Switch to localhost development version
- Prepare to narrate over pre-recorded footage
- Keep demo data and screenshots as backup

# Network issues:
- Test internet connection speed beforehand
- Use mobile hotspot as backup
- Have offline demo data prepared
- Consider recording in segments
```
