# ✅ Multi-Artifact Display - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** 🟢 **READY TO TEST**

---

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**

### **Problem:**
When sentiment analyzer generated 3 artifacts (bar chart, radar chart, data table), only the **last artifact was displayed**. Previous artifacts were lost.

### **Solution Implemented:**

#### **Frontend Changes (All Complete ✅):**

1. **MainLayout.tsx** - Changed state management
   - ✅ Store multiple artifacts in array (not single artifact)
   - ✅ Track selected artifact index
   - ✅ Auto-select newest artifact
   - ✅ Comprehensive debug logging

2. **ArtifactPanel.tsx** - Added tabs UI
   - ✅ Display tabs when multiple artifacts exist
   - ✅ Click to switch between artifacts
   - ✅ Show artifact counter (1 of 3)
   - ✅ Debug logging for rendering

3. **ArtifactPanel.css** - Tab styling
   - ✅ Aistra color palette (yellow-green tabs)
   - ✅ Hover effects
   - ✅ Active tab highlighting
   - ✅ Mobile responsive

4. **ChatPanel.tsx** - Enhanced artifact handling
   - ✅ Normalize artifact types (sentiment_bar_chart → bar_chart)
   - ✅ Debug logging for WebSocket messages
   - ✅ Duplicate detection

5. **config.ts** - Port configuration
   - ✅ Changed from port 8001 → 8000 (to match backend)

6. **Cleanup**
   - ✅ Deleted unused `artifacts/` folder

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Verify Backend is Running**

```bash
# Check backend health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected output:
{"status":"healthy","agent_status":"ready"}
```

### **Step 2: Test Backend Artifact Generation**

```bash
# Test sentiment artifacts endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/test-sentiment-artifacts | python3 -m json.tool

# Expected output:
{
    "success": true,
    "artifacts_count": 3,
    "artifacts": [
        {"artifact_id": "sentiment_bar_chart_xxx", "type": "sentiment_bar_chart", ...},
        {"artifact_id": "sentiment_radar_chart_xxx", "type": "sentiment_radar_chart", ...},
        {"artifact_id": "sentiment_data_table_xxx", "type": "sentiment_data_table", ...}
    ]
}
```

✅ **Confirmed Working:** Backend generates all 3 artifacts

---

### **Step 3: Test Frontend**

1. **Start Frontend Dev Server:**
   ```bash
   cd Frontend_v2
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open Browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Open browser console (F12)

3. **Send Test Query:**
   ```
   "Analyze sentiment on Hamas in US, UK, and France"
   ```

4. **Watch Console for These Logs:**

```javascript
// ✅ EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT:

}
🎨 ArtifactPanel Render: {
  artifactsCount: 3,
  selectedIndex: 2,
  hasArtifact: true,
  artifactTitle: "Sentiment Data Export"
}
```

5. **Visual Verification:**

You should see:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Chat Messages           │ [Chart 1] [Chart 2] [Chart 3*]│ ← TABS!
│                          │ ───────────────────────────────│

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Click each tab to switch between:**
- Chart 1: Sentiment Bar Chart
- Chart 2: Sentiment Radar Chart  
- Chart 3: Sentiment Data Table

## 🔍 **Debug Checklist**

If artifacts don't appear:

### **Issue 1: WebSocket Not Connecting**
```javascript
// Console shows:
🔌 Connecting to WebSocket: ws://localhost:8000/ws/analyze
❌ WebSocket error: Connection failed
```

**Fix:** 
- Verify backend is running on port 8000
- Check `config.ts` has correct port

---

### **Issue 2: No Artifact Messages Received**
```javascript
// Console shows:
📥 Received message: content
📥 Received message: complete
// But NO "artifact" messages
```

**Fix:**
- Backend not sending artifacts
- Check backend console for artifact generation logs
- Verify backend code includes WebSocket artifact sending

---

### **Issue 3: Artifacts Received But Panel Not Showing**
```javascript
// Console shows:
📊 MainLayout: New artifact received: {...}
   ✅ Added artifact. Total artifacts: 3

// But panel doesn't appear
```

**Fix:**
- Check MainLayout conditional: `{artifacts.length > 0 && (`
- Verify `currentArtifact` is not null
- Check browser console for React errors

---

### **Issue 4: Panel Shows But Empty**
```javascript
// Console shows:
🎨 ArtifactPanel Render: {artifactsCount: 0}
   ⚠️  Showing empty state: no artifacts
```

**Fix:**
- Props not passed correctly from MainLayout to ArtifactPanel
- Check `artifacts={artifacts}` prop

---

## 📊 **Backend Verification**

Backend is confirmed working:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/api/test-sentiment-artifacts | python3 -m json.tool
{
    "success": true,
    "artifacts_count": 3,
    "artifacts": [...]
}
```

✅ Backend generates 3 artifacts  
✅ Backend serves artifacts via HTTP  
✅ Backend sends artifacts via WebSocket (per backend team)

---

## 🎨 **UI Features Implemented**

### **Tabs Interface:**
- ✅ Horizontal tabs at top of artifact panel
- ✅ Icon + title for each artifact
- ✅ Active tab highlighted with Aistra yellow-green
- ✅ Hover effects on tabs
- ✅ Scrollable tabs (if 5+ artifacts)
- ✅ Artifact counter in header (2 of 3)
- ✅ Mobile responsive

### **State Management:**
- ✅ Stores all artifacts in array
- ✅ Auto-selects newest artifact
- ✅ Prevents duplicates
- ✅ Clears all artifacts on close

### **Debugging:**
- ✅ Comprehensive console logs at every step
- ✅ Easy to track artifact flow
- ✅ Helpful error messages

**Configuration:** ✅ Ports aligned (both using 8000)  

**Next Step:** Refresh your browser and try the sentiment query!

---

## 📞 **Support**

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check backend logs** - Look for artifact generation messages
2. **Check frontend console** - All steps are logged
3. **Verify ports match** - Both should use 8000
4. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
